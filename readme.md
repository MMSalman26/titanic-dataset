# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes information about passengers' demographics and whether they survived or not. We will implement three different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boost Classifier to make predictions.

## Steps to Solve the Titanic Dataset Problem

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Load the Titanic dataset.
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Perform data visualization to gain insights into the data.

### 2. Feature Engineering

- Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance model performance.
- Encode categorical variables to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### 3. Model Selection and Training

- Implement Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boost Classifier.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train each model on the training data.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate each model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Compare the results of the three models to select the best one.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)

- If necessary, perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the chosen model's performance.

### 6. Final Predictions

- Make predictions on the test dataset using the best-performing model.
- Save the predictions for submission.
